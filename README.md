# UnwantedCompany  

Prerequisites:  
Before you start, download and install the following:  

https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.MelonLoader.Loader/releases/download/v2.1.0/MLLoader-UnityMono-BepInEx5-v0.5.7.zip  

https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.22/BepInEx_x64_5.4.22.0.zip  

Once you've got them, extract all the contents from the zip files. Drag and drop everything into your Lethal Company game folder. If it asks you to replace files, go ahead and do it.  

Next, you're gonna want to find your "\Lethal Company\MLLoader\MelonLoader" folder. That's where you'll drop the UnwantedCompany.dll file.

Credits:  
A big shout-out to anyone who contributed their ideas and insights.  
Also thank you to a UC contributor for the spawn enemy.

Note:  
Sorry for any bad code / Bad practices as it has been a few years since I've actually coded something in C#. This was also coded in a day. It was a fun challenge to dive back into C# and try it out again.  

P.S.  
A quick shout-out to the Lethal Company Modding server. You guys sure do love to paste, don't you? And Bizzle, we see you. Keep pasting, buddy. We're all watching.
