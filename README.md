A big shout-out to anyone who contributed their ideas and insights.  
Also thank you to a UC contributor for the spawn enemy.

Note:  
Sorry for any bad code / Bad practices as it has been a few years since I've actually coded something in C#. This was also coded in a day. It was a fun challenge to dive back into C# and try it out again.  

P.S.  
A quick shout-out to the Lethal Company Modding server. You guys sure do love to paste, don't you? And Bizzle, we see you. Keep pasting, buddy. We're all watching.
